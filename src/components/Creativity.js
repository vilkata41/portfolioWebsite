I met many different people with many different beliefs and that inspired me to write everything I learnt down, so that I could pass my knowledge onto everyone else. That is how my first book was born. I was 17 when I finished and published Narrow Boundary in my mother tongue. Now, itâ€™s translated and waiting to be published in English as well.</p>
